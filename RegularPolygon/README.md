# Regular Polygon

*A test program that creates three RegularPolygon objects, created using the no-arg constructor, using RegularPolygon(6, 4), and using RegularPolygon(10, 4, 5.6, 7.8). For each object, display are its perimeter and area.*
 
#### The class named RegularPolygon that contains:
  
*  A private int data field named 𝑛 that defines the number of sides in the polygon with default value 3.
* A private double data field named 𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑒 that stores the length of the side with default value 1.
* A private double data field named 𝑥 that defines the x-coordinate of the polygon’s center with default value 0.
* A private double data field named 𝑦 that defines the y-coordinate of the polygon’s center with default value 0.
* A no-arg constructor that creates a regular polygon with default values.
* A constructor that creates a regular polygon with the specified number of sides and
  length of side, centered at (0, 0).
* A constructor that creates a regular polygon with the specified number of sides,
  length of side, and x-coordinate and y-coordinate.
* The accessor and mutator for all data fields. [accessors are the getters and mutators
  are the setters]
* The method getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter of the polygon.
* The method getArea() that returns the area of the polygon.
